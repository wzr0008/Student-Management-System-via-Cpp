# Student-Management-System-via-Cpp
I created a C++ code that can help professors manage their students. I used inheritance and polymorphism to create an abstract class Student and its two derivative classes Master and doctor, which represent the students whose status are master degree or PhD degree. And created core head file Employee.h that contains the functions' heads and cpp file Employee.cpp which contains the functions. This code can add,delete students and change students's status, for example a master student wants to apply for a PhD degree. We can also extend the feature of code. It is not hard. But my advisor is satisfied my work.
